Hi, I'm Maksym — Junior Full-Stack Developer

Focus: React / Next.js, Node.js (TypeScript)
Values: accountability, meeting deadlines, creativity

About me

I follow clear professional principles and stay results-oriented. I’m not the one to say “I don’t want to” or “I can’t”—I look for options and drive tasks to release. I take initiative on project improvements: proposing and implementing UX/UI, performance, and accessibility enhancements, and reducing technical debt.

Current goal: deepen my knowledge and skills in React/Next.js and Node.js (TypeScript), shipping small features end-to-end: plan → implement → test → docs.

Tech stack

Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript, HTML5, SCSS/Tailwind
Backend: Node.js, Express, REST APIs, JWT/OAuth
DB: MongoDB (Mongoose)
Quality & DX: ESLint/Prettier, Jest/RTL, GitHub Actions, Docker (basic)

Selected projects

Personal Portfolio — responsive portfolio with a “My Projects” gallery
Live: https://sselesnes.github.io/project-group-09/

Promo Landing (team of 2) — responsive landing for a mobile game, from sections & navigation to legal pages
Live: https://tms-zngs.github.io/sugar_blast_land_4/

Chocolate Landing (facultative) — brand landing with clear CTAs
Live: https://sselesnes.github.io/project-DevHive2/index.html

What I'm looking for

Small real-world tasks, code reviews, and team feature work. Open to feedback and continuous process improvement.
